    <p>Contrary to popular belief,Lore Ipsum is not simply random text.It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
        making it over <strong><mark>2000 yaers old.</mark></strong> Richard McClintock,<br>a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up on of the more obscure Latin words,consectetur,from a Lorem Ipsum passage,and going through the cites of<br>
        the word in classic literature,discovered the undoubtable source.Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
        1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The extremes of<br> Good and Evil) by Cicero,written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,very popular during the Renaissance.
        The first line og Lorem Ipsum,"Lorem Ipsum dolor sit<br> amet..",comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
